### Flight Factor 757/767:

* Automatically selects the EHSI to map mode and displays 10 nm range with TFC on initialisaiton. If engines are shutdown the GPU will be brought online.
* Full takeoff calls by both crew, based on the FMS speed entreies, automatic VNAV engagement if not already armed at the acceleration height in FMS takeoff ref page 2.
* Automatic selection of transponder to TA/RA when passing 80kts, if not already turned on.
* Localiser and glide slope calls, which will reset once the loc signal has full scale deflection. Some nusiance calls may be made if the ILS frequency is left tuned in other stages of flight.
* Landing speedbrake calls.
* Go around calls with PNF actively managing aircraft configuration. When pressing the TOGA clickspot on the MCP, the PNF will select flaps 20, select the gear up,   attempt to engage LNAV at 400ft AGL, select climb thrust at the acceleration height, attempt to engage VNAV or FLCH at Flap 0 speed if there is no valid VNAV path.
* After shutdown, the ground crew will connect the GPU, open L1, fwd/aft cargo doors and bring the belt loaders to the aircraft.
