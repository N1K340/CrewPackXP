## Status HUD
The status HUD is located on the left side of the screen by default. It will auto hide when the mouse is not in teh vicinity of the HUD. 

### Explination
>![Status](imgs/CL650/status_ok.jpg)
>
> 1. Title of the loaded aircraft script and version number. Doubles as a hidden click spot to open the aircraft settings.
> 2. Trigger point to run the FO Preflight setup routine.
> 3. -- Not Yet Implemented --
> 4. Status bar which indicates if the TO Callout mode is armed and the current detected vspeeds.  

If the status HUD is moused over during initialisation, it will indicate how long until CrewPackXP is useable.

### Moving the Status HUD
The position of the Status HUD can not be adjusted within the X-Plane environemnte. 
It can, however, be adjusted within each aircraft scripts code.

To adjust the code, open the `CrewPackXP_HS650.lua` file with a text editor and look for the following section on lines 35-37.

```lua
35   -- Settings Window Position
36   local intHudXStart = 15
37   local intHudYStart = 475
```
The `intHudXStart` variable controlls the position of the HUD horizontally on the screen in pixels. `0` being the far left of the screen.  
The `intHudYStart` variable controlls the position of the HUD vertically on the screen in pixels. `0` being the bottom of the screen.  

#### Example
If another X-Plane plugin is occupying the same space and you wish to move the HUD further up the screen:
 - `intHudXStart` can remain the same at `15`;
 - `intHudYStart` can be increased to a higher value. With a monitor resolution of 2560 x 1440, the top of the screen would be 1440 pixels. So the current `475` can be changed to `1200` to keep it from overlapping with the X-Plane internal menu.

 The code would be adjusted to:

```lua
35   -- Settings Window Position
36   local intHudXStart = 15
37   local intHudYStart = 1200
```
