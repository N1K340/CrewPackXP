# Hot Start Challenger 650
* Takeoff calls by both crew based on the Speed entries on the EFIS with automatic engagement of FLCH at 1,000 ft AGL. 
Important to Note:
    - Thurst values require CDU 3 to be on the thrust ref page for departure, the script will make an attempt to select
      the page during takeoff or default to 90% N1.
    - Flex takeoff is only supported if full thrust takeoff is armed first with 'N1 TO' shown on the ATS screen. This
      is required for the script to determine it is taking off and not landing as it is the only engine mode that can be read by dataref. Flex takeoff 'thrust set' call will then be based on 85% N1. A pop up will appear in top left of screen to confirm Takeoff has been armed once 'N1 TO' has occoured.
    - Calls can be reset after a rejected takeoff by coming to a stop and setting the park brake.

* Landing reverse calls
* 1'000 ft to go on altitude captures.
* FO can now preflight the aircraft if selected in the settings. All pins, covers and main gear chocks will be removed, door opened and interior lights turned on. The FO will attempt to start the APU and perform the flight compartment checks. APU faults will require manual intervention to clear.
